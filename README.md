# Felicity
Felicity is DOPE. Yes it is that dope, but it is also Dictionary Orientated Programming Exclusively (DOPE is an adjective by the way...). However, unlike dictionaries in most programming languages, Felicity's dictionary's are ordered.

# Conventions
Conventionally, parentheses are used when multiple functions are clustered together or for the order of operations, curly braces are used for defining lists and square brackets are used for arrays with the "arr" convention. However, syntactically, they can be used interchangably.
